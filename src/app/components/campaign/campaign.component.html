<!--My point is to use hidden input with type range. I use new component ZoomComponent to achieve it.
The only clause is that zoom component should be a sibling to the shape desired to zoom and we should pass it's selector in it -->

<div class="canvas">
    <div class="shape-to-zoom"></div>
    <zoom zoomSelector=".shape-to-zoom"></zoom>
</div>
